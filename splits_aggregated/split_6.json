The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards.\n\nThis is how the statement read before you edited it:\n\n\"\"Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.\"\"\n\nYou said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads:\n\n\"\"The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.\"\"\"\"\n\n...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful.\n\nI saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say \"\"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!\"\". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the \"\"bone-chilling\"\" factor into the mix.\n\nAnyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article.

If you will, please sign your posts to talk and discussion pages with four \"\"~\"\" marks. This will auto-sign and date your posts, for easier use of other editors. Thanks and good luck editing Wikipedia!  \"",

What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative.  The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect.  I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes.",

This information in no way detracts from this article and otherwise, the opening is simply a list of trivial details. At the very least, the opening paragraph of this article should state that the Jacksonville metro pop. (yes, METRO, not city) is ranked 42nd in the U.S. as of 2005, but adding that it is 4th in Florda does not hurt.

Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.\nPURPORT\nThe kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.\"\"\n\nHowever, you are lucky:\nQ.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?\n\n \n\nA.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:\n\n \n\n(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.\n\n(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.\n\n(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.\n\n \n\nThen Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.\n\n          \n\nSo it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam\n\n        \n\nAlso Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, \"\"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time.\"\" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n\n \n\nQ.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?\n\n \n\nA.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.\n\n \n\nQ.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?\n\n \n\nA.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",

The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.\"\"\n\nHowever, you are lucky:\nQ.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?\n\n \n\nA.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:\n\n \n\n(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.\n\n(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.\n\n(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.\n\n \n\nThen Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.\n\n          \n\nSo it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam\n\n        \n\nAlso Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, \"\"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time.\"\" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n\n \n\nQ.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?\n\n \n\nA.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.\n\n \n\nQ.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?\n\n \n\nA.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",

Many external sources confirm Pikachunes as a notably significant act (which is why he is on Wikipedia I suppose). Monday records have recently signed Pikachunes, so I think that makes Monday Records notable by association. Regardless of the Pikachines connection, I also think that an independent record label signing exciting new acts such as this is very notable. I believe (as with most music artist enteries) it is entirley appropriate to include a wiki page on this up coming independent record label, as they sign more and more culturally significant acts such as Pikachunes. Wikipedia is a common source of reference for the music industry, and it is very common place for relevant record labels to be featured along with artists. As well as links to the Monday Records site, I also linked to 3rd party music news blogs who announced the new signing, as they also felt it newsworthy and culturally significant.

While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a \"\"black person\"\". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying \"\"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.\"\"?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word \"\"nigger\"\" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.

Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to \"\"Winston Churchill\"\".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! \nHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?\nWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. \nI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. \nI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\nHa ha ha ha ha!\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \nNO! \nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\n\nTHE END",

Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\nHa ha ha ha ha!\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your <vulgarity>boob-lover</vulgarity> helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \nNO! \nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—<vulgarity>CURSE</vulgarity> YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! <vulgarity>CURSE</vulgarity> kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\n\nTHE END",

But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.\n\nFirst thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.\n\nNow we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.\n\nThere's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.\n\nOk, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.\n\nA full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.\nYou must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.\nThe font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.\n\nNow, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",

Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n\nIt's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. \n\nGood ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.\n\nFor example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.\n\nIt's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.\n\nAnd too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.\nGood riddance!!",

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! \nHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?\nWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. \nI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. \nI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\nHa ha ha ha ha!\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \nNO! \nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\n\nTHE END",

It was Edythe Shepard of Tucson, Arizona who collected a large part of the pieces in the museum and donated them to Rin tin tin.\n\nThere are other issues with other pages such as the Lassie page - you apparently did not follow the \"\"conflict\"\" rules with them (Carol, Joan and Chelsea - yes they are friends of ours and in fact have one of our dogs)and allowed their \"\"version\"\" of facts that surrounded the events associated with Weatherwax. Yet you will not make corrections to things in the Rin Tin Tin article that are incorrect and that are not as self-serving as the statements in the Lassie article. Honestly it appears that you do maintain a double standard.\n\nI now see that you have arbitrarily added that a dog name Rin Tin Tin Smith attended the American Humane hero Dog Award Show in 2011 - there is no dog registered as Rin tin tin Smith and there has never been a dog called Rin Tin tin Smith. Not sure where you got your information but that too is incorrect. The call name of the dog is indeed \"\"Smith\"\" but that is not his registered name. He is Rin Tin tin XII.

I am sure Danny Lerner would appreciate that. If you would like a copy of the contract between First Look and Tierney we can certainly provide that to you. It specifically outlines Tierney's involvement as being only limited to a \"\"mention.\"\" He had no direct involvment in the \"\"making\"\" of the film.\n\nI would hope that you would research further to substantiate the 48 puppy issue. Your argument is that because someone \"\"mentions\"\" it is a book that it is absolutely true. If that is the case then why do you discount other authors, books and writings?  You defend Orlean's writings as though they were your own and discount anyone else's, including English. That is surely a double standard and certainly NOT professional in any manner.\n\nWe would hope that your goal would be to provide correct information to people and to do it in a consistent manner. Apparently that is not your goal as evidenced by your self righteous indignation. In a lawsuit you could be described as having unclean hands. Shame on you.\n  \n\n\"",

I'm not quite sure if there is any point replying at length, as you have obviously decided your opinion on how i stepped on the toes of the collaborative effort you hoped to achieve. I genuinely regret that, and acknowledge that my actions could be seen as offensive, but i know my intentions were good and I do not feel the need to apologise for proactively editing, encouraging other to do so also and doing my best to stick to Wikipedia policy. I really feel i can't win, however, as firstly i'm accused of ignoring fellow editors and forging my own path without acknowledging others, then when i work with Cesar and praise some of his edits, i'm accused of acting like \"\"a team leader encouraging the troops\"\" and not in a good way, i imagine. If proactivity and a policy of boldness is what offends you, then i believe you may have the problem, and not I.\n\nDespite the unfounded attack below - i'm still very keen to encourage your in put to this article, but i'd really rather not get into anymore finger pointing with you.

But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.\nThere is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. \nCastro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. \nYou could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! \nBut you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. \nYou claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. \n\n\"\"Right\"\"!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! \nIt amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.\nDo not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. \nYou do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  \nYou must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.\nThis is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! \nThat is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, \nhe(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.\n\nAsk yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?\n\nMany people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. \n \nCastro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. \n\nFor you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime.

There is a big difference.  If critics wish to comment on what flood geologists actually say, fine.  But at least the actual position of flood geologists should be accurately presented.

No it isn't. You're changing, over and over, the description of the position of mainstream science. That's the exact opposite of what you claim to be doing. If you're \"\"very familiar with WP policies\"\", I have to suppose you simply don't like them. I'm afraid I'm going to enforce them just the same: don't edit war any more, on this or any other article, or I will block you.  | talk .\nAnd you honestly don't see the POV in \"\"known\"\" versus \"\"interpreted\"\"?  Good grief.  You could say \"\"generally interpreted\"\", \"\"almost always interepreted\"\" or possibly someting like \"\"the current consensus is that it is\"\" and they would all probably be acceptable.  Consensus is an opinion.  Present it as fact and you are pushing POV.  Unfortunately majority POV is generally accepted as no POV on WP.  That is a serious flaw, and a significant hit to WP's credibility.  Also, it take at least two to edit war.

The tool of suppression is the argument the devices don't exist, but this is also the excuse for never looking at them at the same time. We cant have it both ways? Either the machines don't work or the theory is wrong. We cant assume the machines must work because the theory has to be wrong just like we cant assume the theory must be right because the machines cant work. Most people will continue not believing it's real even after being confronted with such device. They will stand there screaming about the laws of thermodynamics. People like the inventors twin brother, or their wife. Not very likely to convince a wikipedian if you cant convince your wife now it is? The suppression is not so much executed by special interest groups as by the mainstream dogma. The dogma is however much supported by the special interests.\n\nSigns of real professional free energy suppression you can see here on wikipedia. Every actor in history is worthy of his own page but weird inventions not confirmed by mainstream science (working or not is irrelevant) apparently cant have a page here. The few free energy machines still having their own wikipedia page are full of rant how crackpots try to destroy the laws of thermodynamics and how nutterish they are, not your usual trolling but the work of experts. Take the introduction of the Water fuel cell. \"\"the source of this addition energy has not been scientifically identified therefore the theory is treated with skepticism.\"\" There was barely any theory, it just worked! And it has not been investigated. The way it's treated is not worthy of being in the description. An encyclopedia should not instruct it's readers behaviour? Tell me how to treat things huh? \"\"such a practice conforms to the parameters of perpetual motion, hence conclusive scientific investigation would either verify violation of thermodynamic law or identify the source of claimed additional energy.\"\" But if there isn't going to be any scientific analysis - ever! then the laws of thermodynamics are nonsense. If the best scientists can do is preach the laws then it's just not very likely they are right about the topic. Then it says: \"\"At least one car prototype, reportedly powered by a water fuel cell, has been assembled.\"\" HUH what? but but but?? You know what I mean? \"\"Meyer's claims about the Water Fuel Cell and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996.\"\" His wiki use to say \nURLTOK\n\"\"It failed to work during a required demonstration of the water-fueled car. An Ohio court found Stanley Meyer guilty of fraud in a case brought against him by disgruntled investors.\"\" So he was scammed by his own investors. What kind of person would do that with a known to work invention? And why was this important information deleted? Then it says: Stanley Meyer was granted patents in the United States and abroad starting in 1989. The verifiability, and scientific basis, of the patents are controversial. Now I know the water motor patents where granted after a working model was displayed. You can see it in the application number. There is no other way to get a patent on an electrolysis cell. Because of those laws of thermodynamics you know? You do know about those right? You can see free energy suppression live at work when you see that the world famous American inventor Stanley Meyer was not worthy of his own wikipedia page. It's obvious he cant have a page because that would violate conservation of energy right? Paul Pantone does have his own page where again the working of his device is denied by no-witness, The GEET page however describes a Hindi film? BTW Paul was also scammed by his investors? ha-ha?

What about William A. Rhodes? Dennis klein then? no? Isaac de Rivaz? Daniel Dingle? etc etc?? At least we still have the Oxyhydrogen page right? haha? This is how free energy suppression is done. I would love to make a page for each one of them with most credible references but it's just not going to be allowed. The wall of propaganda is much to thick.

But you cannot mention this without also pointing out that this was in large because Communist parties made it the established view in the states they governed.   The association is a historical one, not a logical one, and it is true that there are critics of atheism who try to discredit atheism as a philosophy because of its historical association with Communism (a point mentioned in the article), but the NPOV response to this is NOT just to neglect to mention this important historical association.  12:28, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)",

He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.\n\nTo that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans. I got an email back from wiki stating that he will be reviewed - thank god! His place in wiki - and in the US - shouldn't be secure.",

I will be watching a video, fullscreen and whatnot, been watching for 15 minutes, and then suddenly I hear a terribly loud advertisement just start playing. So I pause the video, minimize it, and look over to the right and see the ad window, screaming at me to buy this product. I then have to mute my computer because its one of those ads that don't have any sort of volume control or pause button. So I wait until its over and wait for the video after the ad to load and then pause it and continue my video. 15 minutes later, history repeats itself. Seriously, I'm not going to buy any Dove products for at least the next months out of sheer fury toward that event. I dunno if it's the people that own the ads or if it's you guys who maybe programmed something incorrectly, but it's just awful, and I would like to suggest that you maybe change that. \n Myself and the person above CANNOT be the only people having these problems with Veoh. Basically the sole administrator (yes, this site has just one, and he's a condescending asshole) says you have to go off-site and get download something to deal with it, rather than to simple change the way advertisments work on the site. The invasive ads deserve some kind of mention in the article. Period.",

I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.\n\nI do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope.

Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking \"\"research\"\" from questionable sources and only ever \"\"research\"\" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have \"\"won\"\" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5.

Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.\n\nYoutube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves.

When you say one thing, but do another, AND justify it, as in it isn't merely a mistake or a moment of weakness, that to me is hypocrisy.  But I guess I'm wrong.  Apparently we can never know what someone Actualy believes or feels, because they may be Lieing when they state their feelings or beliefs.  Therefore their statements, and their actions, are not reliable reflections of their Actual beliefs or feelings, and no judgment can be accurately made as to whether they are hypocrites.  This is making my head spin, and hurt alot.   \n\n I really think we need a WORD to define when someone's behavior does not match their stated positions, beliefs, opinions, or whatever.  Putting it under \"\"double standard\"\" is not putting a WORD to it.  For instance, say I'm playing an online game, and I meet someone who Kills me, and claims they hate it when people Kill others on that game, and their justification for killing me is that they have been killed by others and are now angry and taking it out on random players.  I am a victim of a victim.  Is this an example of hypocrisy?  Or is it an example of \"\"double standard\"\"?  If it is a \"\"double standard\"\" being applied by the one who killed me, what words do I use to accuse them of their incongruous behavior?  \"\"You are a Hypocrite!\"\" apparently does not apply, so, do I say \"\"You are applying a Double Standard!\"\"?  Somehow it just doesn't have the same Punch.   \n\n To me \"\"Double Standard\"\" relates only to how one decides how different groups should be treated based on their behavior.  If a man commits murder, and whether he is found guilty or not depends solely on the color of his skin, that is a Double Standard, aka Racism.  The differences between how Women and Men are treated in the work place, or by employers, is another example.  A woman can get maternity leave to take care of a new baby, but a man cannot.  I detect a Double Standard there as well. \n\n If I constantly and publicly state that I am against circumcision in all cases, and then have my own child circumcised, am I a hypocrite?  If I am totaly against abortion, but force my daughter to have an abortion, am I a hypocrite?  Have I actualy stated my real beliefs, or was I lieing?  Was my behavior based on my REAL beliefs, and my stated beliefs were lies?  My head hurts too much to keep going. \n\n This is all My Humble Opinion, and I am probably quite stupid and an idiot.\"",

Does it mean they're of African ancestry? No.   \"",

However, I now see that the original Megatron IS listed under \"\"Animation villains\"\", as is Galvatron, despite both also being listed under their respective villainous Transformers factions, which themselves are listed as \"\"Villain groups\"\".  There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category \"\"Animation villains\"\".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.

            "Comment_marked": "\"== Should be listed under \"\"Animation villains\"\" ==\n\nAwhile back I edited the article to put Megatron into the categories of the following:\n\n\"\"Fictional mass murderers\"\"\n\"\"Fictional evil geniuses\"\"\n\"\"Animation villains\"\"\n\nThe first two have since been kept, but the third one was quickly taken out, but I was alright with that happening, since I assume the person who removed it figured that because he is listed under \"\"Predacons\"\" and \"\"Vehicons\"\", his status as a villain is already there (since both the article for Vehicon and the article for Predacon are listeed under \"\"Villain groups\"\"), and so actually listing Megatron as a villain would be completely redundant.  However, I now see that the original Megatron IS listed under \"\"Animation villains\"\", as is Galvatron, despite both also being listed under their respective villainous Transformers factions, which themselves are listed as \"\"Villain groups\"\".  There can't be a double standard here, I don't think.  I really think that this Megatron should indeed  be listed under the category \"\"Animation villains\"\".  I really don't think that saying he is simply a Predacon or a Vehicon is enough, as really he was far more than that, particularly in Beast Machines, where it actually seems that calling him a Vehicon is erroneous.  I mean, he created the Vehicons, and led them, but I don't think he really was one himself, no matter what form he was in.  So, I would really like to put him under the category \"\"Animation villains\"\", but I'm afraid someone would once again remove him from the category.\"",

You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. \n0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any\nradix system.\n\nYou mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r\nsuch that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then \nwhat are the integers q and r such that the above is true?\n\nSuppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.\nFor example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the\ndivision algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.\n\nNow suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:\n\n1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!\n\nI want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation.

What's up, Doc? \n\nI'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!\nOh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   \nHis IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. \nBack on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   \n\nSo according to you, it's enough to only \"\"suspect\"\" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you \"\"suspect\"\", how sure is that?! why didn't you even \"\"wonder\"\", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don't you think ?!\nI can't believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info.. simply pitious.—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) \nI guess we should leave the 'no high-school' line in there.  It has nothing to do with 'scietific' vs 'non-scientific'.   His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    \nI added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   \n\n Works for me.  I'm guessing if he can teach college without a high-school degree, he could have attended college as well.  -)    \n\nThe IP again demonstrates that he's either a troll or an idiot, or both.

You are all way to triggerhappy with your so-called 'fair' judgements on users you have never really checked the backgrounds on. THAT is insulting enough by itself. Especially considering how it started. I never started it. Look it up if you want. (most of you are too <vulgarity>lazy</vulgarity> to ever really do that) So again: As long as you insult me, either by blocking me unrightfully, I will insult and if necessary annoy you back. 194.109.22.149",

DilbarJan(/NisarKand) claimed he would helping Taliban but since Beh-Nam is a Persian and the Taliban were looking for cleansing Tajiks who could he be NisarKand self since Dilbar is allready NisarKand!? Plz dear Admins, unblock him. Beh-Nam is for a long time on Wikipedia and he didn´t do sth bad either against any nations nor against any User or any articles. The admins of Wikipedia now banned two or three of Tajiks who were one o the important ones here at least they were the sole Tajiks who were active.

You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  \n\nI know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.

            "Comment_marked": "\"YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION==\n\nThis is the most \"\"contructive\"\" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  \n\nI know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.

Suppose that there were links to Talk:Second city (with a lowercase c) on various pages across the wiki.  When Talk:Second city gets moved to Talk:List of second cities, it is usually a good idea to redirect the old talkpage so that those links will go to the right place.

            "Comment_marked": "Note that in some cases it is a good idea to have a talk page be a redirect.  Suppose that there were links to Talk:Second city (with a lowercase c) on various pages across the wiki.  When Talk:Second city gets moved to Talk:List of second cities, it is usually a good idea to redirect the old talkpage so that those links will go to the right place.  If the talk page were simply left blank, people clicking onto it would be confused.  There don't seem to be any such links currently however, so that rationale doesn't really apply.

The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.

A recent series of short autobiographies seems interesting though I believe the Alun Watkins book was described as anodyne.\nIncidentally I believe a tension has grown up between Cricketarchive and the ACS.(Last AGM) Oh and I am not a member but know several very well.)",
